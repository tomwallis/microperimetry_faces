Characterisation of field loss based on microperimetry is predictive of face recognition difficulties
======

These are R scripts to reproduce the analyses in Wallis, Taylor, Wallis, Jackson & Bex (under review).

These files are released under the GPL-3 License. I don't offer any support. You are welcome to send me an email but I make no claim that I will (be able to) help, particularly if you are attempting to use a different platform / setup than me (I'm running on OSX 10.8 with RStudio).

**IMPORTANT**: If you adapt any part of these scripts for your own academic work, please help keep me employed by citing the following paper:

Wallis, T.S.A., Taylor, C.P.T., Wallis, J., Jackson, M.L. and Bex, P.J. (under review). Characterisation of field loss based on microperimetry is predictive of face recognition difficulties.


Reproducing the analysis
========

Analysis steps:
To reproduce the paper, run the sampling (bayesian_percentCorrect_3level_sample.R) then the plotting (bayesian_percentCorrect_3level_plot.R). Correlation plots are produced by the correlations script.
