pete's key point: Figure 3c: the orientation bandwidth in 3c is clearly more narrow after learning. How does this fit with no changes in the individual tunings?

-- why are the TVC functions in fig4i-l so flat? - like a classification image? Why is the threshold here so good? Shouldn't it be the worst performance??

-- Steven: is it because they are computing on a fixed-point performance based on fisher info, rather than computing a full psychometric function for orientation discrimination?}

- p2: is it true that perceptual bias can only arise at the decoding stage? Assumes that the noise is Gaussian. If the encoding noise is instead skewed, this could result in both the bias and variability.

- "biases are not observable when comparing same-noise stimuli, as both stimuli presumably have the same bias". Is this true? What about other possible biases, e.g. right versus left, judged versus comparison?

annote = {20055550; /9/13/17/ To characterise the human visual system, it is important to consider the characteristics of the stimuli and tasks the system has evolved to perform. Two broad approaches to this are Collect statistics of natural stimuli, describe their statistical structure, then interpret that structure in terms of "efficient coding" principles. Focus on specific natural tasks, characterising those statistics of stimuli that are relevant for performing the task efficiently. The first approach has the weakness that the properties identified may not actually be relevant to natural tasks; the second approach has often involved weak selection of properties to examine (based on intuition and historical precedence) rather than principled analysis. The present study seeks to determine relevant stimulus properties for two natural tasks using a principled and unbiased method. The approach is outlined thus: Assume a small number of "neurons" (a limited channel) Realistic neuronal constraints: a maximum response typical of cortical neurons, and a response variance proportional to the mean response Optimal decoder is the Bayesian ideal observer (who's input is the neural population response), in the sense that the decoder always picks the most likely stimulus given the population response. The optimal encoder for the stimulus and task is then built from these constraints. If the optimal encoder for this limited neural channel can be determined (i.e. the optimiser converges), this has three advantages: the encoding properties "necessarily represent the most relevant stimulus properties for a given task" the optimal encoder shows how best to utilise limited neural resources for a given task principled starting point for determining the actual stimulus properties used Tom: Does this account necessitate one group of "encoders" for all possible perceptual tasks? How are unnatural tasks performed by the visual system? Could a "base group" of encoders, evolved for natural tasks, be "co-opted" for any arbitrary task? Method summary: Accuracy maximisation analysis {(AMA)} The environment (e.g. an object category) is represented by a vector w(k). the stimulus produced by w(k) is given by s(k,l), which is the sensory input of object category k given by exemplar l. The encoder then acts to turn this sensory input into a population response for q neurons (with the restrictions on firing rate above). The sum of each neuron's response is the mean population response (firing rate?), with an additive sample of noise for each neuron, who's variance can depend on the mean and can be correlated across neurons. This population response is fed into an optimal decoder (decision rule that picks the most likely category given the neural population response. The optimal encoder could be found by searching over all possible encoders for the highest accuracy, but since this is computationally prohibitive (could Tobias' nonparametric method be used here???), Geisler et al instead attempt to minimise the relative entropy (uncertainty) between population responses to different object categories. That is, maximise the classifier across the large stimulus set. This becomes a function minimisation problem.}

Is the pedestal effect because of a nonlinear transformation of low-contrast signals, or because of a reduction in stimulus uncertainty (e.g. positional uncertainty)? Targets were Gaussian bars. Pedestal was a full-field drifting grating. This provides little information about the test stimulus. If facilitation is eliminated, suggests effect is due to uncertainty reduction of a localised pedestal. Data still showed a pedestal effect. Supports an accelerating nonlinearity of contrast gain for low contrasts {(Legge} \{\&} Foley 1980).}

They suggest their results speak to a divisive reduction in signal strength during suppression, rather than an increase in intrinsic noise and subsequent thresholding. 2. They did not measure very low pedestal contrast (the "dipper" facilitation) because "binocular rivalry alternations are impractically sluggish". Measured {TvC} functions for sinusoidal Gaussian targets in dominant and suppressed phases of rivlary. Their results showed an upward shift in the {TvC} function for suppressed phases compared to dominance, with no difference in slope. This is similar to Caetta et al for suppressed phases of {MIB.} Note that they do not make an attempt to equate adaptation states for dominance and suppressed (time through trial to signal state). Note also that smaller contrast increments (after several staircase reversals) did not break perceptual state, but instead resulted in mixed percepts. Conclusions: "... this contrast gain control for transient luminance increment does not require perceuptual visibility of the pedestal contrast." The upward shift in {TvC} without an apparent slope change (inferred from variance) implies that suppression involves a "divisive reduction in signal strength rather than a noise infusion to the signal pulse..."}

Is temporal summation corrected for by a special "motion-deblurring" system (e.g. in the form of spatiotemporally-oriented receptive fields, Burr et al 1986) or that motion blur does cause spatial blur, but not to such a degree that it is noticable? Morgan and Benton showed that spatial-interval discrimination deteriorated with motion, but vernier acuity did not. However, this "is not sufficient proof against a general motion-deblurring mechanism if the sensitivities of these tasks to spatial blur are not equal". Assumption: "that motion blur is treated as an equivalent... amount of spatial blur in the later stages of analysis." Present study extents Watt and Morgan, who showed dipper-function for blur discrimination for stationary edges. Velocity should increase the internal blur and shift thresholds accordingly. Their data show dipper functions for blur discrimination. That is, the optimum reference blur for blur discrimination is slightly greater than zero. In addition, the optimum blur seems to shift to higher blur values with greater velocity. Their data also show that the velocity dependence of motion blur is linear - implying that "there does not necessarily have to be any type of motion blur other than cameralike blur to produce our results". They argue that their modelling provides an alternative account for the psychophysical data of Burr et al 1986 (instead of spatiotemporal receptive fields): they may show "how motion blur, i.e., the velocity and the temporal filtering, modifies the appearance of the underlying spatial filter in space-time coordinates." They suggest a two stage model of temporal integration: the first is a "cameralike exposure phase" which produces blur; the second autocorrelates the spatial information of an object irrespective of changes in position on the retina (see Badcock \{\&} Wong).}

annote = {19810793; /9/10/12/ Natural scenes are dominated by low frequencies (spatial and temporal). 1/f slope of spatial (or temporal) frequency vs amplitude (plotted on log log axes). How does the visual system deal with this bias? Inputs are "whitened": the response of the system to high {SF} / {TF} is amplified and the response to low {SF} / {TF} is attenuated, meaning that the response of the system to 1/f spectra is equalised (or has a slope of 0). Experiment 1: Spatial whitening (replication) Observers rate whether a noise patch is "low spatial frequency dominant" for patches filtered with various slopes (i.e. spatial exponent). The mean point of subjective equalisation (i.e. 50\% "low sf dominant" responses) occurs at -0.9, close to the measured spatial exponents for natural scenes and well away from the exponents for physically equalised patches. Experiment 2: Temporal whitening Same for temporally filtered noise patches. Observers rate whether the patch is "low temporal frequency dominant". Again, the subjectively equalised stimuli occurred for when the physical exponent was around -1, indicating that the system also temporally "whitens" its input. Experiment 3: Temporal equalisation point as a function of spatial frequency More temporal luminance variation at fine spatial scales due to fixation instability {(Rucci} et al., 2007). Does the visual system's transient response bias take this into account? This was indeed the case. The subjectively equalised point at 4 cpd was around -1, and increased to -0.4 at 8 cpd. There was also a similar reduction at low spatial frequencies (ie the plot of sf versus tf equalisation point was bandpass). It is uncertain why this is the case: maybe because there are more V1 neurons driven by intermediate {SFs}, or maybe because of low {SF} suppression / high {SF} excitation reported in macaque. Why is the temporal transient bias (whitening) observed? Early transient bias (more neurons tuned to these frequencies). Interactions between different temporal "channels", one low pass "sustained" channel and one (or two) bandpass "transient" channels. Whitening here could result from interactions between channels and/or different channel gains and/or saturation contrasts. Because channel bandwidths increase as a function of linear frequency in the spatial domain, more frequencies are integrated; predicts a proportional increase in favour of higher frequencies {(Brady} \{\&} Field, 1995). The integrated response is therefore whitened. The paper refers to (2) and (3) as the independent channels account of temporal whitening. Experiment 4: Temporal frequency masking Both temporal frequency masking and whitening show similar asymmetries between high and low tf. Are they a common mechanism? Masking of {ST-filtered} targets by {ST-filtered} noise shows a temporal asymmetry: {1Hz} targets are well masked by noise from 1 - 13 Hz, whereas 15 Hz targets are not masked by low {TF} noise ({\textless}8 Hz). This pattern can be modeled as an inhibition of the low frequency channel by the high frequency channel. Such a pattern could equalise the 1/f amplitude spectrum, producing whitening. This can be distinguished from whitening in the spatial domain, which can be produced by summation across independent log-spaced channels {(Brady} \{\&} Field). In the temporal domain, the channels are not independent but linked via asymmetric inhibition. Functionally however, both result in whitening. What is the mechanism of the temporal whitening? Now three possible mechanisms: independent channels account (see above) asymmetric inhibition account: transient channel actively inhibits sustained channel (reduces signal) asymmetric noise account: sustained channel is more susceptible to noise in the transient channel than vice versa (passive). Experiment 5: Temporal frequency adaptation Adaptation of an inhibitory mechanism reduces the inhibition, whereas adaptation of an excitatory mechanism reduces the response. Therefore, the models above hold different predictions for adaptation. The pattern of sensitivities after adaptation was consistent with model (3). After adaptation to low {TFs}, sensitivity to low {TF} targets was greatly impaired, and sensitivity to high {TF} targets was slightly impaired. After adaptation to high {TFs}, both low {TF} and high {TF} sensitivity were equally impaired. Conclusions The asymmetrical pattern here is different to {MAE} studies, which show evidence for independent channels {(Alais}, Verstraten \{\&} Burr, 2005; van der Smagt et al., 1999). The difference is that these studies used broadband stimuli - so the results are not very comparable. Masking and adaptation may reflect separable processes for transient adaptation of low com...}

Results show a "dipper function": when one of the patterns had no variance, thresholds were relatively high. As variance was added, thresholds fell (i.e. performance was facilitated), before rising again {(Weber's} Law). These results could be due to 1) Intrinsic noise Second-order computations (e.g. of variance, rather than first-order such as an average) have greater intrinsic noise (?). E.g. intrinsic orientation noise. 2) Internal noise with a sensory threshold The extent of facilitation is greater than predicted by an intrinsic noise model. 2/3 observers better fit by internal noise + threshold model. {"The} effect of the threshold will be to make textures appear slightly more regular than is in face the case..." 3) Channel uncertainty Not sure which is the best channel to use. Nonzero pedestal flags the best channel. Hard to explain present results with this account. 4) Multiple channel models of variance discrimination There could be multiple channels for variance discrimination. Should be revealed by selective adaptation.}

Their psychophysical findings in auditory domain should also be replicable in visual domain. {"Hidden} states" of neuronal networks represent state changes which are not accessible to downstream neurons (as they do not generate spiking activity), but will instead change the response of the network to the next stimulus presented (even if it's the same stimulus as the last one). The hidden state can provide "a memory trace that can span periods of network quiescence", and will influence subsequent active states. {"State-dependent} networks" propose that cortical networks are inherently capable of encoding time, as a result of the influence of hidden states on active states. Somewhat counterintuitively, they argue that "neural trajectories" (the active state changes associated with particular stimuli or inputs) are better discriminated in many-dimensional space. They point to higher-level "read-out neurons", which receive input from thousands of neurons - thus may discriminate different neural trajectories. This is distinct from an "attractor convergence" approach - the "hypothesis that cortical computations rely on neural networks that converge to steady-state attractors ... states in which neural firing rates remain constant for a minimal period of time". Refers to an interesting psychophysical paper in which they demonstrate that interval length discrimination is impaired when the intervals are presented close in time, but only when the tones are the same frequencies. Presenting tones of different frequencies close together did not 'interfere': possibly because the tones were encoded in different cortical networks?}

journal = {Journal of Vision},
year = {2010},
volume = {10},
number = {14},
annote = {Sets up two accounts of {MIB:} low-level mechanisms (e.g. filling-in, adaptation and motion streak suppression) combine with higher level perceptual interpretation factors (e.g. depth ordering). {MIB} is an instance of perceptual bistability - competition between cortical representations. The paper sets these up as alternative accounts, though it is not clear to me that they are. Microsaccades have been suggested as a cause for {MIB:} rate or probability of microsaccades decrease before disappearances, and increase before reappearances. Since these studies do not include physical removal control conditions, and microsaccades can be influenced by perceptual or cognitive events, what is cause and effect here? Two hypotheses if microsaccades: moving mask should alter microsaccades even in the absence of {MIB} targets changes in microsaccades during illusory disappearances should be different to changes during physical removals It is not clear to me that 1 is necessarily true - why can't it be an interaction between mask and target? Methods Experiment 1 is passive fixation viewing a rotating mask. Experiment 2 is reporting disappearances of a target surrounded by a moving mask {(MIB} condition), followed by a block of physical disappearances in which the previous session reports are replayed {(Replay).} In half the Replay conditions there was no mask present, while in the other half the mask was the same as in the {MIB} conditions but rotated very slowly. Eye data is broken up into epochs around disappearance reports, and microsaccade rate is compared for +/- 3 seconds leading up to a report. A Poisson process modelled transitions, with rate modulated by microsaccade onsets. Results Experiment 1: No statistical difference between rate, velocity or temporal distribution of microsaccades between static and moving mask conditions. The moving mask therefore does not seem to alter microsaccades in the absence of {MIB} targets, relative to {BLANK} {SCREEN} (why wouldn't they compare to a static mask?). Experiment 2: Microsaccade rate decreases before disappearances (more for illusory than for physical), and increases before reappearances ({\textasciitilde}0.5 sec before, consistent with button response delay). Replay condition doesn't show this spike preceding reappearance. This seems to me to nicely illustrate a causal role for microsaccades in {MIB.} How are they arguing differently? Model They set up a model based on a time series of microsaccades by one observer during 10 mins of passive fixation. The model is good at accounting for rate changes that occur prior to perceptual transitions, but not the rate changes that occur afterwards. The authors suggest this means that microsaccades change based on perceptual events (disappearances/reappearances). The probability of a disappearance / reappearance occurring spontaneously after 0.5 sec of visibility / invisibility in the model was 0.33. For 0.5 sec after a microsaccade, this was 0.7 for reappearance (microsaccades dramatically raise the probability of reappearance) and 0.25 for disappearance (a microsaccade makes a disappearance slightly less likely than spontaneous). The crux of this argument from the model is that the probability of reappearance after a microsaccade is not 1, and the probability of preventing a disappearance is not 1, therefore microsaccades can't be the only cause of disappearances. Conclusions The authors conclude that microsaccades can modulate {MIB}, but are "neither necessary or sufficient" to account for it. Multiple targets can disappear independently, arguing against a global adaptation brought on by stabilisation. The moving mask triggers some "independent", "central mechanism" whos "critical role... in inducing disappearances does not involve microsaccades and thus remains to be found." -- hello?!? what about temporal masking?}

Localise the basis of long-range apparent motion to the anterior-temporal lobe of the ventral pathway - not to a motion area. Activation fluctuation with "form stability". Fluctuations in the apparent shape of form with apparent motion. This is interesting - "intermediate forms" between form endpoints. Note their figure/surround difference in motion-defined forms - couldn't get {AM} when shapes were defined by moving dots against a static background. How does this fit in with our {X/K} stimuli?}

annote = {8637596 Neural coding in mammals is known to be Spatially localised. Neurons respond to stimulation at a certain point on the retina (visual space). Oriented. Cortical neurons show orientation tuning. Bandpass. Neurons span a range of spatial scales, and are selective to some band of information within a scale. How might the known properties of cortical visual neurons arise from the structure of the natural world? It is assumed that visual neurons provide some representation of the retinal image. This representation is a summary of the information in the image. It would be desirable to have independence between dimensions of this summary, to provide a maximally efficient code. Efficient coding {"The} goal of efficient coding is to find a set of basis functions that forms a complete code (that is, spans the image space) and results in the coefficent values being as statistically independent as possible over an ensemble of natural images". Efficient coding would provide a way to exclude redundant information and extract structure in sensory input, and has adaptive physiological benefits (e.g. less energy expended on neurons that are sparse-coded from a more full representation). Question: What does this mean for brain damage? If neurons are not redundantly-coded, should we expect to see more deficits from localised brain damage than we do? Could brain damage be tied to disruptions of a sparse code? So, how might sensory neurons encode the input image efficiently? Principle component analysis Find orthogonal basis functions that capture maximum variance. This analysis produces basis functions that don't look like receptive fields: they are not localised. Moreover, {PCA} is good for capturing {"Gaussian} cloud" data, but natural images contain "higher order formas of statistical structure, and there is good reason to believe they form an extremely non-gaussian distribution..." (see Field, 1994). How can these higher-order statistical properties be taken into account? The search for a minimum-entropy structure Lowering the individual basis function entropies while preserving the joint entropy (all information in the image) reduces the statistical dependence of the basis functions. Such a set of functions is a "minimum entropy" {(Barlow}, 1989) or sparse code. That is, "any given image can be represented in terms of a small number of descriptors out of a large set". Olshausen \{\&} Field characterise this as an optimization problem: maximise sparseness while preserving information. {"Preserving} information" is quantified as the image contrast (mean square) between the representation and the original image: higher error means less of the original image is preserved. {"Sparseness"} is quantified as a cost for inefficient representations: "those representations in which activity is spread over many coefficients should incur a higher cost than those in which only a few coefficients carry the load". For representations with equal variance (i.e. equal information), those with the lowest number of non-zero coefficients will be favoured. This algorithm then learns by minimizing the cost function weighing "information preservation" against "sparseness". {"An} intuitive way of understanding the algorithm is that it is seeking a set of basis functions for which the coefficients can tolerate "sparsification" with minimum reconstruction error. Importantly, the algorithm allows for the basis functions to be overcomplete (that is, more basis functions than meaningful dimensions in the input) and non-orthogonal, without reducing the degree of sparseness in the representation." In Tom's words: orthogonality and efficiency are not explicitly coded by the model, so if they emerge in the results, they could be considered an emergent property of a requirement for sparseness. Method \{\&} Results The learning rule described above is tested using several artificial datasets. Sparse pixels (each pixel independently activated) looks like pixels with white noise sparse gratings (sparse pixels in the Fourier domain) looks like gratings with white noise sparse gabors looks like gabors with white noise. Each of these sparse structures is evident in the recovered basis functions. Training the learning rule on a database of natural image patches yields basis functions that appear like neuronal receptive fields: localised, different spatial scales, oriented. The sf bandwidths of the basis functions are similar (a little bit more narrow than) to V1 receptive fields. The vast majority of coefficient weights are near zero (i.e. sparse). Conclusion With the only restrictions that coding be sparse and that information be preserved, the model shows the emergence of localised, oriented, bandpass receptive...}

What is the resolution of spatial discriminations by motion mechanisms compared to those by luminance contrast? Using only a difference in retinal image velocity across an object's boundaries, Regan shows that motion-sensitive mechanisms can indeed support figure-ground segregation. Vernier thresholds for a motion-defined dot were not significantly worse than for a luminance-defined dot! Surprising to have {\textasciitilde}30 arcsec thresholds for motion when spatial summation fields for motion are estimated at 2 deg!! {(Note:} observers' impression is of an illusory orientation, not of a vernier step). Thus, vernier threshold of motion-defined bars may be determined by the relative activity of motion-sensitive, orientation-tuned neurons (in an opponent-process-style system). In cases where a clear vernier step was the cue, sensitivity might result from relative activity of motion-sensitive neurons with non-spatially overlapping receptive fields.}

It's just a behavioural manipulation of attention. {"Probability} of disappearance" showed that the attended target was more likely to disappear than the unattended target. Time before disappearance showed little difference (average {\textasciitilde}6 sec to signal disappearance). High attentional load at fixation resulted in slower perceptual switching rates and longer durations of suppression than no-load and low-load conditions. So, directing spatial attention to a target results in greater probability of disappearance without influencing time-to-disappear. {"Conversely}, increasing the attentional load in a central task unrelated to {MIB} decreased the number of disappearances and reappearances of the target and prolonged the periods of its perceived visibility and invisibility."}

annote = {7463185 To date of this paper, there exists no model of contrast masking. Note Fig. 2: Shifts in position of dipper with varying masker frequency relative to signal frequency. They note that simple summation cannot account for the dipper function, "because signa`l thresholds are reduced by masking contrasts well above the unmasked threshold..." I take this to mean that the masker can easily be detected, so simple summation would predict an impairment of detection. Masking functions are more broadly tuned to spatial frequency than the pedestal effect - pedestal is quite tightly tuned to signal {SF.} Note that this is not true for narrow fields: for 0.7 dva fields, pedestal effect becomes broadly tuned. At low contrasts ({\textless} 1\%), decision seems to take the detector with the biggest difference - i.e. spatial pooling. At high contrasts, no spatial pooling is a better fit to the data. Some terms: Masking: The effect of one stimulus on the detectability of another where the stimuli are coincident in spacee and time. Negative {masking/Facilitation/The} Pedestal effect: A low contrast masker can increase the detectability of a signal. Contrast discrimination: Telling the difference between a signal and masker with the same spatial frequency. Also called contrast increment detection. Many papers show that contrast discrimination thresholds increase more slowly than predicted by Weber's law.}

E.g. fixing lambda at 0.01 provides unbiased estimates of threshold and slope if the observer's lapse rate is 0 {\textless} lambda {\textless} 0.02. However, in practice, an observer's lapse rate is likely to vary between 0 and 0.05 across experiments. Number of trials: 20 trials per level in a {MoCS} is too small a number for a reliable estimate of threshold (see Figure 3). Need at least 40.}
